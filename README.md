# Path-Finding
# You are a zookeeper in a zoo with a bunch of animals. Everyday, you (the zookeeper) should provide food and water for the animals. In order to minimize the expenses of the zoo, you are planning to devise a systematic way to feed the animals. Your plan is to first make paths to each animal cage to deliver food, and then to construct canals to provide fresh water to all animal cages. Your task is to identify the most efficient routes for providing food and water to the animals.
